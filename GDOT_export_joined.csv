Current (2016) Average Annual Daily Traffic (AADT) along SR 101 is 8450 with 5% truck traffic. Future (2041) traffic volumes are projected (assuming an annual growth rate of 1%) to be 11,000 AADT. Currently, the intersection operates at a C level of service during peak hour. Installing turn lanes on SR 101 would improve the Level of Service to a B level. The crash rate the SR 101 @ Tumlin Lake intersection between 2013 to 2016 (which is the latest data available) was above the statewide average for similar functional classifications of intersections (State Route with Other, Rural, Unsignalized Intersection). Additionally, during the past 5 years, there have been 6 correctible injury crashes."

The intersection has channelized left and right turn lanes inside the acute angles of the intersection that each provide approximately 30 feet of storage. Grassed islands are located between the channelized lanes and the center of the intersection. The channelized turn lanes are controlled by stop signs. SR-247 Connector includes one shared left-turn/through lane and one channelized right-turn lane on each approach. Housers Mill Road includes a channelized left-turn lane and a shared through/right-turn lane on each approach to the intersection. This project proposes to convert the intersections of SR 247 Connector and Housers Mill Road into a single lane elliptical roundabout.

The bridge consists of a two (2) span truss swing bridge on a massive center column along with 49 spans of Reinforced Concrete Deck Girders (RCDG¿s) on concrete caps with concrete piles. This bridge was designed using an HS-15 vehicle, which is below current design standards. The structure is currently posted for weight restrictions. The overall condition classified as fair. This bridge is classified as having an unknown foundation and therefore could be at risk for scour. Due to the age of this structure, the posting of the bridge structure, the structural integrity of the bridge pertaining to the design vehicle, the damage to the steel truss section, unknown foundation of the substructure, replacement of this 94 year old bridge is recommended."

This bridge consists of 2 spans of concrete deck on concrete piles supporting concrete caps. This bridge was designed for an H 10 vehicle. This bridge is posted for reduced loads and is scour critical. Moderate scaling and spalling is present throughout the top of the bridge deck. A large portion of the deck is either delaminated or spalled with exposed rebar. On the underside of the deck are large spalls in both spans with exposed rebar. The exposed rebar has corrosion swell and surface rust. The piles at bent 2 have severe scale/abrasion below the cap all the way down. In addition, the left forward wing wall has heavy deterioration and scour with undermining. Due to the condition of this bridge, load striction, and scour criticality, replacement is necessary."

The bridge consists of 3 spans of reinforced concrete deck girders on concrete wall units. The design load is unknown. This bridge is posted for load restriction due to extensive concrete deterioration throughout and the low original design capacity of the structure. The bridge is also scour critical. The bottom side of the deck has very extensive transverse and longitudinal cracking with leakage and efflorescence. The beams have minor to moderate cracking throughout. One abutment has an exposed footer and undermining with exposed piling that consists of guardrail posts and railroad track rails. A replacement structure is required to upgrade this structure to a point where posting is no longer required.

For the next 0.96 miles a 32¿ median is proposed. For the remaining 1.36 miles it varies between a 20¿ raised median and a 14¿ flush median. In the city limits and near CS 546/ Bolden Street the alignment shifts onto new location. The new location alignment is approximately 750¿ west of existing US 441.

Old Alabama Rd is included as Route 35 in the State approved ""March to the Sea Program"" for bike lanes in the Georgia Bicycle and Pedestrian Plan; therefore, the design of the outside shoulder for the project includes bike lanes.

A programmatic section 4f for historic bridges is available for use. The new bridge of like kind will be built in the original location and the railroad will be shifted back to its original location. This will avoid a 4f situation. The proposed typical is a two lane rural section with 100' right of way.

There is transverse cracking over the deck joints and the bottom of the deck. There is erosion under the cap at abutment 1 exposing one timber pile. There is minor settlement under the abutment 4 cap and vertical cracking is present in the caps. Checks are present on all the timber piles. There is minor erosion at both banks around the structure.
